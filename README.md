# NUS-Problem-Sets
A compilation of problems I've done before starting university. I don't claim my answers to be the most efficient answers or correct, as I have no one to check on my answers. 

These solutions are just from me learning more about coding, and I learnt these from reading notes on the website on my own. 

All problem sets are from AY 19/20, and I didn't do all of them.

I think I didn't use the function 'free' after allocating memory from heap a lot, oops!
